This work is joint research with Suji Lee, Seokjin Han, Sewon Park, and Jaeyong Lee, 2017 - 2019.

In this project, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning model combining BNN with Korean speech recognition. Specifically, we combined BNN to implement the end-to-end model and obtain Monte Carlo estimates. We carried out experiments on the online dictionary dataset. In this project, I studied algorithms for inference in BNN models. We implemented Variational Dropout (Gal, Y., & Ghahramani, Z., 2016) to develop a model that can infer uncertainty in Korean natural language recognition problems. We presented the results of this project at *Eastern Asia Chapter of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis* and published in *The Korean Journal of Applied Statistics* in 2018.
