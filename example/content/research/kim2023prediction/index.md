This work is joint research with Kyeongeun Kim and Miru Ma, 2021 - 2023.

In this project, we conduct statistical analysis with the air quality data that covers the entire South Korea using statistical and machine learning methods. Overall, I maintained this project and conducted and directed the data collection, analysis, and writing of the paper. I carried out data preprocessing, machine learning-based model fitting, and visualization in the data analysis phase. During the writing and submission paper, I managed the project source code and communicated with reviewers. The result of this project was published in *Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods* in 2023.
