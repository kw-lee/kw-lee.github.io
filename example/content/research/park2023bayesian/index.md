This work is joint research with Daeun Jeong, Heungkook Ko, Sewon Park, and Jaeyong Lee and supported by Samsung Electronics, 2021 - 2023.

The data generated from the semiconductor manufacturing process have characteristics of non-normal distributions, random missing patterns, and high missing rates, which complicate the prediction of the yield. We propose the Dirichlet Process - Naive Bayes model (DPNB) that can simultaneously impute missing values and address classification problems. In this project, I implemented models based on neural network models and was a co-author of the paper. I implemented GAIN (Yoon, J., Jordon, J., & Schaar, M., 2018) and MIDA (Gondara, L., & Wang, K., 2018) using `PyTorch`. Through this task, I have improved my skills in using GPU cluster servers. The result of this project was published in *IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing* in 2023.
