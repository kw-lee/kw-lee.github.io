This is a classroom homepage I **personally (not official!)** deployed for the *Fall 2018 semester's Statistics Experiment 010 course* at Seoul National Universiy. It contains basic statistical concepts and examples of R code. The page has been made public for those who might need related content even after the class. While all matters related to students' personal information have been removed, if you happen to find any, please email me.

The homepage was created using Rmarkdown and is being deployed using GitHub Pages.
